<p>This past July, 2011, I had my first month-long gallery exhibition, <em>Bubbles &amp; Boxes</em>. The pieces were selected from a collection of abstract oil paintings and digitally generated artwork from the past few years.</p>
<p>When I paint I follow a natural flow of patterns, shapes and textures. I look to create realms that pulls me into a place of curiosity and imagination. I consider the fundamental elements in my work to be the ambiguity of space and time, rhythm, ordered chaos and fluidity of a line.</p>

<p>The <em>Boxes</em>, or oil paintings emerged organically from meditations on nature, music, poetry and architecture. The paintings are influenced by subjects as diverse as Egyptian Hieroglyphics, wild flowers, a forest canopy, John Coltrane and rock striations. Each painting began as three or four colors that were mixed directly on the canvas until completion.</p>

<p>In contrast to the abstract oil paintings, the <em>Bubbles</em>, the computer generated mandalas (Sanskrit for ‘magic circles’) are symmetrical, ordered, and highly structured. They too began as colors and patterns, but were put through precise systematic movements.</p>
